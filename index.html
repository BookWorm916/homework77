            Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>
        <p>The console screen is a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system.</p>>
